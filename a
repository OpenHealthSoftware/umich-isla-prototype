Questions:
what kind of info do you need:
	-patient info and how to store it
what resolution screens are you working on
what browsers
do you want to see the whole normal image?
grading patients throughout time (need comparisons between?)
are the images being used going to be the | Optos Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopes models that have been transformed into a stereographic projection (identifiable as these have a dimension of 4000x4000 instead of 3900x3072)| ? If not, are the 3900x3072 images have the same pixel mapping?
what do the graded files need to be like?

Considerations:
Putting the graded cell on top of the flipped cell
displaying info for graded images
see the full normal image


distortion example:
109572-13_FA_OD_1 vs OD
